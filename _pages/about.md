## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Iâ€™m **Tameem Bakr**, a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Machine Learning at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where I am supervised by [Dr. Nils Lukas](https://nilslukas.github.io/). My focus is on **trustworthy AI**â€”particularly model and content watermarking, robustness, and generative model security.

Iâ€™m also a **Research Intern at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/)** in Saarland, Germany, working under the guidance of [Dr. Adam Dziedzic](https://adam-dziedzic.com/) and [Dr. Franziska Boenisch](https://franziska-boenisch.de/) in the [SprintML Lab](https://sprintml.com/), where I work to explore cutting-edge watermarking methods for image auto-regressive models.

My work aims to improve AI safety, security, and transparency by developing practical, reliable, and research-driven solutions that bridge the gap between academia and industry.

If you're interested in collaborating with me, feel free to [connect on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tameemalaa), browse my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/tameemalaa), or send me an [email](mailto:tameem.alaa@gmail.com).
